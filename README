How to build the Signalization API from source:

1. Checkout and import the Signalization project from GitHub (https://github.com/michaelvanderheeren/Signalization).
2. Check if the build path contains references to the libraries (*.jar) inside the libs folder of the Signalization project.
3. Make sure the correct native library is selected for the RXTX communication library. This depends upon your operating system and can be set in the build path.
